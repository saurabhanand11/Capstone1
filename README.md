This project is the analysis on Pima indian diabetes patient.

Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. To study the reason that leading to diabetes, a cluster of dataset about Pima Indian Diabetes was used. It is consisted of 8 predict variables and 1 response variable. 

This project emphasizes on predicting the onset of diabetes in Pima Indians. Dataset has been taken from UCI ML repository. Source for this data is from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This contains data in particular, for all patients who are females and at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The research people is Pima Indian Female diabetics, which are 768 in the dataset used. The goal of this project is to predict the probability that individual females have diabetes and detect subgroups of characteristics that are at higher risk of diabetes .The higher risk subgroups contain four variables, pregnancies, glucose, BMI and Diabetes pedigree function Taking dataset for 768 patients, 9 variables were taken to fit in a different statistics model to predict the probability that individual females have diabetes using Train and test dataset (80:20)

Final objective of the analysis is to make predictions on whether a person is to suffer the diabetes given the features in the dataset.
